# Architecture

This is a simple and developer friendly architecture 
we create components 
we import the components in a Page 
The page folder will export an index file with the routing logic
services is responsible of creating api instances 

```sh
src
  components // sore components
  pages      // pages 
  services  // api instances 
  utils   // utils function 

```
## Time  management 
If the project was in normal condition  i will firstly improve : 
1- UI components ( CARDS , icons , .... )
2- Add an Alert components 
3- test the key compnents 
4- improve css code and responsive (DRY)
5- Crate a useForm custom hook  (DRY)
6- Add Chart js in the dashboard 
7- improve routing file ( create a descriptive object {path , Component ,...})
8- Minimize the requests ( store key data in state , maybe using Context API or Redux)
